## Version 1.0.0-preview.251222.1
- Changed `AITool[]?` parameter in simplified `CreateAgent` methods to be `IList<AITool>?` for consistency
- Fixed that the OpenAI based simplified  `CreateAgent` methods (aka not using AgentOptions) forced `ClientType.ChatClient` instead of using the default in the Connection.
- Fixed that if ClientType was not set on Agent Level, Reasoning Effort was not properly added
- Fixed that MCP Tools could be defined but not called
- [BREAKING] GitHub: Renamed `PersonalAccessToken` or `AccessToken` as it do not need to be personal all the time (it can example be generated by a GitHub App)
- Added Unit/Integration-tests to try and avoid silly mistakes like those in previous and this release in going forward.

---

## Version 1.0.0-preview.251220.1
- Fixed that not all OpenAI based `CreateAgent` methods would set the `LoggerFactory`, `ClientFactory` and `Services` (Thank you to [LennartJohansen](https://github.com/LennartJohansen) for pointing it out in [#26](https://github.com/rwjdk/AgentFrameworkToolkit/issues/26)

---

## Version 1.0.0-preview.251219.1
- Added central build management and reorganized project structure (Huge thanks to [gurolg](https://github.com/gurolg) for [PR#24](https://github.com/rwjdk/AgentFrameworkToolkit/pull/24) doing the work)
- Add [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rwjdk/AgentFrameworkToolkit/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) (Again thanks to [gurolg](https://github.com/gurolg))

  - Removed Agent Display name as AF does not have it anymore

  - Resolved new OpenAI Nuget Package renames in ResponsesAPI
- Renamed `ToolCallsHandler.ToolCallingMiddleware` to `ToolCallingMiddlewareAsync`

---

## Version 1.0.0-preview.251217.1
- Added `AIToolsFactory` to make it easier to create and define AI Tools
- [BREAKING] Obsoleted `OpenAIAgentOptionsForChatClientWithoutReasoning`, `OpenAIAgentOptionsForChatClientWithReasoning`, `OpenAIAgentOptionsForResponseApiWithoutReasoning` and `OpenAIAgentOptionsForResponseApiWithReasoning` as these names were 'too much' and confused (Use AgentOptions instead (with `ClientType` and `ReasoningEffort` Enums to control the option))

- OpenAI: Added `WithOpenAIResponsesApiReasoning` and `WithOpenAIChatClientReasoning` Extension Methods for `ChatOptions` (if you do not wish to use AgentFactory, but still wish to have an easier time to set OpenAI Reasoning)
